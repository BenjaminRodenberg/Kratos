    This simple geometric response function calculates the sum of all shape updates in
    surface normal direction. Shape update in surface normal direction is considered positive,
    in the opposite direction negative.

    Note that the direction of the surface normals changes in every step,
    this is why the response value is not a meaningful measure but only an indication on how much the shape changed.
